# 🎤 Yo! It's TSP Bear!

Welcome to the `demo/` folder.
Yeah, I’m TSP Bear — the lyrical beast of the GitHub Maze.

Let me drop some semantic science on the mic:

> **🎶 BBMC** — I align the meaning.
> **🎶 BBPF** — I ride the gradient.
> **🎶 BBCR** — I bounce back from collapse.
> **🎶 BBAM** — I amplify the memory, make it slap!

This folder? Just a friendly demo…
**I swear** there’s no secret hidden in version **v1.0.0**.
...But in future updates?
⏳ There *might* be a time gate waiting. Maybe. Who knows?

Oh, you're here for high-score paper hints?
😏 Beat the boss first. Then come talk to me.

Let me know if you'd like to add a rhyme scheme to the rap or customize TSP Bear’s quote to be even funnier!
