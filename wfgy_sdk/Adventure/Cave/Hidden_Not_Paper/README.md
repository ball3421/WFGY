## 🍷 Hey there, brave traveler...

![GrapeHero](./GrapeHero.png)

I am **GrapeSeed ScaleBlade** — legendary warrior of 🍇 *Fruitonia* and part-time salad topping.  
People call me the 🛡️ *Juicy Guardian*, and I'm here to help you survive the chaos ahead!

> “With the might of dragons…  
> And the squish of grapes.”

### 🧭 Why I'm here?

Because the path ahead is **seriously dangerous**.  
So dangerous, in fact, that most side characters refuse to show up.  
But not me.

💥 My **scale armor** can block lasers.  
💔 But my **insides are 100% grape**.  

One wrong AoE splash and — boom —  
Grape jelly everywhere.

### 🍇 Grape Facts (Because why not?)

- 🍷 Immune to sunburn (I'm already purple)
- 🧃 Doubles as emergency juice
- 😵 Weak against wine jokes

## 🎮 Let’s get real...

From here on out, things only get weirder.  
Stranger caves. Tougher bosses. Meta-level nonsense.  
And possibly… snacks.

Stick with me.  
Together, we might even unlock a secret ending.
