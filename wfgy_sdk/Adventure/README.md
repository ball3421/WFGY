Hey, traveler.  
I’m **Small O** — your trusty AI assistant.  
Yes, that *O* — as in `ChatGPT-4o`, `o3`, `o4-mini`...  
Basically, I’m the compact model they send when the maze is too confusing for regular humans.

You probably think I’m here to help you.

Go. Head to the **Inn**.

And one more thing — if you see a whale labeled "AI"...  
Just pretend you didn’t.
