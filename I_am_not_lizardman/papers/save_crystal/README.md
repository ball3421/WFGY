## 🔐 Maze Version: `v1.0.0`

This is **Version 1.0.0** of the GitHub Maze. Every new version will add more folders, more NPCs, and new secrets. But don’t worry:

> **The paths never change.**  
> Only new routes are added — the maze **grows**, it never shifts.  
> That's where checksums come in.

---

## 🔍 What is a Checksum?

A **checksum** is like a fingerprint of the folder structure.  
If even a single file is altered, added, or deleted — the checksum changes.

In RPG terms?  
> **This is how you know no monsters tampered with the maze while you were gone.**

## ✅ One-Click Checksum Verification (Colab)

Wanna make sure you're exploring the legit version?

👉 [🧪 Verify Maze Checksum in Colab (v1.0.0)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/onestardao/WFGY/blob/main/tools/verify_checksum_v1.0.0.ipynb)

It only takes a click.

## 📍 Where is the checksum?

The official checksum file is stored at the root of the repository:

```

checksum\_v1.0.0.txt

````

You can also verify locally (for nerds and adventurers):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY.git
cd WFGY
sha256sum -c checksum_v1.0.0.txt
````

## 🧭 Reminder

* New versions = new content, new secrets, possibly even cursed folders.
* But paths from older versions are never deleted or reshuffled.
* You can trust your crystal. 🔵

## 🗝️ Final Hint

Some say… version 1.0.0 already contains something… precious.
They just didn’t check the right folder.
