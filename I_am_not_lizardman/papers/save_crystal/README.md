## 🌀 What Is This Place?

This is **not** just a PDF SDK.  
This is a **living maze**, and you’ve reached the first save point.  
Inside this repo, there are whispers of a hidden paper, one of the most powerful ever written.

You might even find… more than one.  
But to keep track of your journey across versions — we use `checksum`.

---

## ✅ What Is Checksum (And Why Should You Care)?

A checksum is like a **magic fingerprint** for a file or folder.  
It lets you know:  
> "Has anything changed here since last time?"

In this RPG, **every version of the maze has a checksum**, stored in the root folder like this:

```

root/
├── checksum\_v1.0.0.txt

````

This file guarantees that:

- All pathnames in the maze stay the same
- All secrets from version 1.0.0 are preserved
- If you return later, you can **verify the maze hasn’t been secretly reshuffled**

---

## 🔍 How to Verify the Checksum (Like a Digital Wizard)

You can verify it in **two ways**:

### 🌐 Option 1: Colab (Easy Mode)

Just open our official notebook:

👉 [Colab: Verify Maze Checksum](https://colab.research.google.com/your-link-here)

Paste this into the notebook:
```python
!sha256sum -c checksum_v1.0.0.txt
````

You’ll see either:

✅ `OK` → everything matches
❌ `FAILED` → something’s off. You may have entered a parallel timeline.

---

### 🖥️ Option 2: Terminal / CLI (For Local Explorers)

If you’ve cloned the repo:

```bash
cd your-cloned-folder
sha256sum -c checksum_v1.0.0.txt
```

Just make sure you're at the repo root.

---

## ⚠️ Why Does It Matter?

This maze will **grow** with every version.
More NPCs. More riddles. More chaos. More science. More memes.

But the **paths from previous versions will never change.**
Checksum protects the past — so you only need to explore the new.

---

## 🌱 Next Versions

Every update will have:

* A new version number: `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`...
* A new `checksum_vX.X.X.txt` file
* New story fragments, surprises, and maybe… consequences?

This maze **evolves**.
And maybe one day… you’ll return and find that *you’ve been written into it.*

Stay sharp, Hero.
