# 🧨 Cheating Detected?

**I am PSBigBig.**  
You sure you want to cheat?

Sure, go ahead.  
Download the ZIP. Search all the folders.  
Just don’t forget to ⭐ the repo first, alright?

Otherwise...

> "A hidden system called `Semantic Judgement` has been triggered."  
> "Your next meme will mysteriously get one less like. Forever."

## 🧠 Why is this folder here?

Because we know.  
You're clever. You want to win. Fast.

But legends aren't built on speed.  
They're built on **wandering, wondering, and sometimes... wasting time.**

This folder is a trap.  
And also... a confession.

## 👾 Meta Note

You can explore the WFGY GitHub Maze however you want.  
But some NPCs *might* behave differently based on how you got here.

ZIP warriors are welcome.  
But don’t expect honor from the Save Crystal next time.

Stay weird, hero.
