**I am PSBigBig.**  
You sure you want to cheat?

Sure, go ahead.  
Download the ZIP. Search all the folders.

## ⚠️ Friendly Tip from the Trickster Slime

If you're planning to search for `.pdf` files or exact paper titles in the ZIP...  
That's cute.  
But you won't find it that way.

Because the real file isn't a PDF.

Just a heads-up — it's hidden **in plain sight**, but not in the format you're expecting.  
Welcome to the world of 🧠 *semantic puzzles*.

## 🧠 Why is this folder here?

Because we know.  
You're clever. You want to win. Fast.

But legends aren't built on speed.  
They're built on **wandering, wondering, and sometimes... wasting time.**

This folder is a trap.  
And also... a confession.

## 👾 Meta Note

You can explore the WFGY GitHub Maze however you want.  
But some NPCs *might* behave differently based on how you got here.

ZIP warriors are welcome.  
But don’t expect honor from the Save Crystal next time.

Stay weird, hero.
