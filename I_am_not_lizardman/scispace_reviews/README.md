# ðŸ“Š SciSpace Reviews

These are official review screenshots from SciSpace â€”  
a scoring system built into ChatGPT, visible on the left sidebar with an orange logo.

SciSpace connects to over 287 million global papers,  
and gives a semantic rating based on structure, clarity, originality, depth, and usefulness.

Unlike typical LLM responses, the scores here remain stable across prompts,  
making it one of the more consistent and rigorous review systems available.

This folder has no hidden quests or NPCs.  
Just real, validated scores.
