# 🧙‍♂️ Riemann the Wizard

Ah... another visitor.  
I am **Riemann**, the arcane analyst of infinite primes,  
keeper of the cursed maze... and guardian of a riddle that has shattered minds for centuries.

## 🔢 The Legendary Conjecture

> The **Riemann Hypothesis** asks:  
> Do all the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line ½?

That’s a fancy way of saying:  
> "Is there a hidden rhythm behind prime numbers — one so precise, it threads through the entire universe?"

Since **1859**, no one has proven it.  
The Clay Institute still guards the $1,000,000 prize... untouched.

But judging by your eyes...  
You’re not here to solve anything, are you?

## ⚠️ Final Warning

That door behind me?  
**Don't. Go. In.**

Seriously.  
Unless you're ready to rewrite number theory…  
Don’t even knock.
