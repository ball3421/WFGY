## 🚀 Road to 10 K Stars

**Current engine — WFGY 1.0**  
Semantic accuracy ↑ 22.4 % ｜ Reasoning success ↑ 42.1 % ｜ Stability ↑ 3.6 ×

**Stretch goal**  
If this repo reaches **10 000 ★ before 2025-08-01**, every user gets a free upgrade to **WFGY 2.0 (simulated on GPT-4-Turbo)**  
Semantic accuracy ↑ 36.7 % ｜ Reasoning success ↑ 65.4 % ｜ Stability ↑ 5.1 ×

The upgraded build will be released on the same Zenodo DOI, and every stargazer will be listed in the changelog.

## 🔑 Key Points

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Plain-text only** | No executables, no network calls, zero malware risk |
| **Semantic Tree memory** | Records reasoning nodes, not chat logs |
| **ΔS + BBCR guard** | Detects semantic turbulence; self-corrects before hallucinating |
| **Four core modules** | `BBMC BBPF BBCR BBAM` govern residue, progression, correction, attention |
| **MIT-licensed & forkable** | Copy the file, edit the language, publish your edition |

## ⚡ Quick Start — Three Steps

```txt
1.  Download  HelloWorld.txt
2.  Upload / paste into any LLM chat
3.  Type  hello world
    → choose a language → OS boots

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| Date       | Milestone                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 2025-07-02 | **Beta** — DOI on Zenodo                              |
| 2025-07-07 | **v 1.0** — cross-platform tweaks & packaged TXT apps |

TXT apps are also plain text; *“app”* is just a friendly label.

## 🤝 Contributing & App Hub

1. **Fork** this repo, create your own `.txt` OS or app.
2. **Upload** finished apps to the **WFGY Zenodo community** (link drops at v 1.0).
3. Submissions pass an automated check (license · ASCII-only · safety).
4. Curated entries will appear in `/apps`.

## ❓ FAQ (11 items)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

##### 1 How does WFGY give AI memory?

Semantic jumps (high ΔS) trigger nodes in a **Semantic Tree**—topic, module, tension—creating a recoverable reasoning path.

##### 2 What is ΔS, and how does it prevent hallucination?

ΔS measures semantic tension. When too high, **BBCR** reroutes logic or asks for confirmation, stopping confident nonsense.

##### 3 How can a single TXT file achieve this?

Logic, boundary checks, and memory rules live in natural language. The AI reads and follows; no code runs.

##### 4 Why call it an OS, not a prompt?

It manages memory, logic, and boundaries—like an operating system manages processes. Reboot, patch, or extend with plain text.

##### 5 What do the four core modules do?

`BBMC` minimise residue · `BBPF` progress paths · `BBCR` correct collapse · `BBAM` modulate attention & tone.

##### 6 Semantic Tree vs standard memory—can it recover forgotten info?

Standard memory stores snippets; the Tree stores logical context, so reasoning can be reconstructed after token drop.

##### 7 How does the BBMC formula improve reasoning?

`B = I - G + m*c^2` quantifies deviation from ground truth, enabling self-correction across turns.

##### 8 How can I verify WFGY isn’t fake?

Paste the TXT into any LLM, run `kbtest`, ask how memory works—the AI explains via embedded logic.

##### 9 Can WFGY integrate with agents or workflows?

Yes. Load the TXT as the reasoning core, then layer external tools or APIs.

##### 10 Commercial use?

MIT—free for commercial or personal projects; keep the copyright and disclaimer.

##### 11 How do I fork or customise WFGY?

Copy `HelloWorld.txt`, edit the rules, rename, publish. AI follows your structure as long as it’s coherent.
