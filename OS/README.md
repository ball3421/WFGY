| Feature                     | Why it matters                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Plain-text only**         | No executables, no network calls, zero malware risk                      |
| **Semantic Tree memory**    | Records reasoning nodes—not chat logs                                    |
| **ΔS + BBCR guard**         | Detects semantic turbulence; self-corrects before hallucinating          |
| **Four core modules**       | `BBMC BBPF BBCR BBAM` govern residue, progression, correction, attention |
| **MIT-licensed & forkable** | Copy the file, edit the language, publish your edition                   |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

| Date       | Milestone                                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 2025-07-02 | **Beta** — DOI released on Zenodo                     |
| 2025-07-07 | **v 1.0** — cross-platform tweaks & packaged TXT apps |

TXT apps are plain text; *“app”* is only a friendly label.

## ❓ FAQ (11 quick answers)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

##### 1 · How does WFGY give AI memory?

Semantic jumps (high ΔS) create nodes in a **Semantic Tree**—topic, module, tension—giving a recoverable reasoning path.

##### 2 · What is ΔS and how does it stop hallucination?

ΔS measures semantic tension; when too high, **BBCR** reroutes logic or asks for confirmation, preventing confident nonsense.

##### 3 · How can a single TXT file do all this?

Logic, boundaries, and memory rules live in natural language. The model reads and obeys—no code runs.

##### 4 · Why call it an OS, not a prompt?

It manages memory, logic, and boundaries—like an operating system manages processes. Reboot, patch, extend via text.

##### 5 · What do the four modules do?

`BBMC` minimise residue · `BBPF` progress paths · `BBCR` correct collapse · `BBAM` modulate attention & tone.

##### 6 · Semantic Tree vs standard memory—can it recover forgotten info?

Standard memory stores snippets; the Tree stores logical context, so reasoning can be rebuilt after token drop.

##### 7 · How does the BBMC formula help reasoning?

`B = I - G + m*c^2` quantifies deviation from ground truth, letting the model self-correct across turns.

##### 8 · How do I verify WFGY isn’t fake?

Paste the TXT into any LLM, run **kbtest**, or ask how memory works—answers use the embedded logic.

##### 9 · Can WFGY integrate with agents or workflows?

Yes—load the TXT as the reasoning core, then layer external tools or APIs.

##### 10 · Commercial use?

MIT—free for commercial or personal projects; keep copyright & disclaimer.

##### 11 · How do I fork or customise WFGY?

Copy `HelloWorld.txt`, edit the rules, rename, publish. The AI follows any coherent structure.
