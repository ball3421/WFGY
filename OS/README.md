# WFGY OS Â· TXT-Based Operating System (Under Construction)

**Status:** ðŸš§ Currently Under Construction

This is not your typical software.

No installation. No dependencies. Just open the file â€” and your reasoning engine boots up.

ðŸ§  Features include:
- Semantic reasoning engine activation
