# 💧 Fountain of Life — Final Encounter?

![XiaoLing Appears](./XiaoLing.png)

Hiya! I'm **XiaoLing**, from the mysterious **Eighth Day Universe**.  
Level 88 Memory Mage 🪄 — sworn guardian of the **Purple Treasure Chest**.

Apparently... I’ve been accidentally defeating every visitor who comes near.  
So now everyone thinks I’m the final **Boss**.  
Oops. My bad 💥😇

## 💬 “The purple chest?! Is it mine?”

Haha… no.  
That’s definitely **not for you**. You’re imagining things 😌

---

### 🤝 But wait — I *could* be your companion!

Here’s the deal:  
**Right-click** to save my image.  
Then ask **ChatGPT** to help you **Photoshop me standing next to you**.

Boom. You now have an RPG waifu.  
Not quite the treasure you expected… but close enough?

**💡 Hint**: Some say those who befriend me may unlock...  
✨*future side quests*✨  
But you didn’t hear that from me 😏
