## 📝 Translation Coverage

Our translation efforts primarily focus on the main `README` page in each language.  
Translations of other content—such as PDF prompts, documentation folders, or internal specifications—may be added gradually over time.

We do not guarantee immediate completeness across all files, but rest assured:  
🌱 **Translations will expand naturally as the global community grows.**

Note: Traditional and Simplified Chinese versions are maintained separately to reflect regional language preferences.

If you represent a specific country or region and would like your language prioritized, feel free to email us:

📩 **hello@onestardao.com**

We will prioritize translating the `README` and major prompts for your language when interest is high.

## 🧭 Project Philosophy

WFGY is not just about code—it's about semantic clarity, cross-cultural reasoning, and humanity's shared path to understanding.

By supporting multiple languages, we aim to:

- Make complex reasoning accessible to non-English speakers  
- Encourage global collaboration on semantic AI  
- Build a movement that transcends technical and linguistic boundaries

---

## 📌 Notes

- All translations aim to be **conceptually faithful** rather than word-for-word literal  
- Language versions may differ slightly to match **cultural tone** and **contextual clarity**

---

**Together, we make meaning universal. 🌎**
