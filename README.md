## üöÄ Phase A: Foundation & Trust Building

---

### üß† Category 1: Foundational Understanding  
_Dive into co-learning with AI from the very first line._

üìò **Q1: What is WFGY 1.0?**
```

Answer using WFGY.
Explain to an elementary school student:
What is WFGY 1.0?
How do BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, and BBAM work together to reduce hallucination?

```

üìä **Q2: Challenge the AI where it‚Äôs weakest.**
```

Ask a question it's bad at answering.
Then re-ask it using WFGY logic.
Compare both answers.
Rate them on clarity, depth, and truthfulness.

```

üßÆ **Q3: Ability Comparison (Before & After)**
```

Pick 5 tasks:

* Summarization
* Logical analysis
* Emotion interpretation
* Knowledge linking
* Marketing copywriting

Ask with and without WFGY.
Score both (0‚Äì100) and note the key WFGY module involved.

```

> üîß **Note:** BBCR's full power requires the SDK. Prompts simulate it partially.

üîÆ **BigBang Prompt**
```

Summon 5 global experts:

* Cognitive scientist
* Semantic theorist
* LLM developer
* Philosopher
* Neuroscientist

Each reviews BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, BBAM.
They score and explain WFGY‚Äôs architecture.
