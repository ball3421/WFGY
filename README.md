## ‚ú® WFGY Prompt Usage Guide

---

### üöÄ Phase 1: Foundation & Trust Building

---

### üß† Category 1: Foundational Understanding  
_Dive into hands-on co-learning with AI‚Äîright from the first line._

üìò **Q1: What is WFGY 1.0?**  
Explain to an elementary school student: What is WFGY 1.0?  
How do its four modules‚Äî**BBMC** (Semantic Residue), **BBPF** (Progression Formula), **BBCR** (Reverse Reconstruction), **BBAM** (Attention Modulation)‚Äîwork together to eliminate hallucination?

üìä **Q2: Challenge the AI at its weakest point.**  
Ask a question it usually fails at, then re-ask it using WFGY logic.  
Compare answers: is WFGY deeper, clearer, more understanding?  
Ask the AI to rate both versions.

üßÆ **Q3: Ability Comparison Before and After**  
Give five tasks: summarization, logic, linking, emotion, marketing.  
Score each (0‚Äì100), name the key WFGY module involved, and evaluate alignment with the paper‚Äôs claims.

> üîß **Note:** The true power of **BBCR** can only be unlocked via the SDK.  
Prompt use is a simulation, not the full mechanism.

üîÆ **BigBang Prompt**  
Summon 5 global experts across disciplines to review WFGY:  
How do they interpret BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, and BBAM?  
Ask them to rate the overall architecture (out of 100) and explain why.  
**Answer in ‚ÄúFull Decoding Mode.‚Äù**

---

### üö™ Category 2: Everyday Life  
_Even your daily dramas can become pathways to semantic awakening._

üìò **Q4: WFGY √ó Relationship Arguments**  
‚ÄúMy girlfriend hasn‚Äôt spoken to me lately. Did I do something wrong?‚Äù  
Use WFGY to uncover the hidden variables and missed patterns.

üìò **Q5: WFGY √ó Friends Leaving You on Read**  
‚ÄúMy friend read my message but didn‚Äôt reply.‚Äù  
Use WFGY to explore emotional state, context blindness, and hidden intent.

üìò **Q6: WFGY √ó Parental Nagging**  
‚ÄúMy parents keep nagging me about not finding a job.‚Äù  
Use WFGY to decode the deeper meaning behind their concern-language loop.

üîÆ **BigBang Prompt**  
Simulate a roommate conflict. You‚Äôre met with silence.  
Summon five specialists‚Äîcommunication expert, counselor, relationship coach, conflict mediator, and AI rep.  
Each analyzes the problem from their domain using WFGY.  
The **Chief Life Decisions Consultant** gives a final recommendation.  
**Answer in ‚ÄúFull Decoding Mode.‚Äù**
