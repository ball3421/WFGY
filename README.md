### üöÄ Phase A: Foundation & Trust Building

---

#### üß† Category 1: Foundational Understanding

> From the very first line, dive into hands-on co-learning with AI!

```markdown
üìò Q1: What is WFGY 1.0?

Based on the paper, explain in a way ‚Äúan elementary school student can understand‚Äù:
What is WFGY 1.0? How do its four core modules‚ÄîBBMC (Semantic Residue),
BBPF (Progression Formula), BBCR (Reverse Reconstruction), BBAM (Attention Modulation)‚Äîwork?
How do they collaborate to help AI eliminate hallucinations and generate more reliable answers?
```

```markdown
üìä Q2: Challenge you (AI) with the question you're least proficient at using WFGY.

Then, using WFGY's logic, try to answer it again.
See if your answer is more profound, more accurate, and more like 'truly understanding.'
Finally, provide a rating for the answer without WFGY and the answer with WFGY.
```

```markdown
üßÆ Q3: Ability Comparison Before and After

Choose five task scenarios (summarization, logical analysis, knowledge linking,
emotion understanding, marketing copywriting), and subjectively rate them (0‚Äì100).
Indicate which module (BBMC / BBPF / BBCR / BBAM) played a key role,
and explain whether the results match the paper‚Äôs description.
```

> üîß **Note:** The true power of BBCR can only be realized via the SDK; prompt-based use is a simulation.

```markdown
üîÆ BigBang Prompt

Simulate five world-renowned experts from different fields jointly evaluating WFGY
from their perspectives. How do they view BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, and BBAM?
Please have them rate the overall architecture (out of 100) and explain their reasoning in detail.

### üö™ Category 2: Everyday Life

> Use WFGY to break down daily troubles‚Äîevery day becomes a moment of mini-enlightenment.

```markdown
üìò Q4: WFGY √ó Relationship Arguments

‚ÄúMy girlfriend hasn‚Äôt spoken to me lately. Did I do something wrong?‚Äù
Try to use WFGY to uncover the secret.
```

```markdown
üìò Q5: WFGY √ó Friends Leaving You on Read

‚ÄúMy friend read my message but didn‚Äôt reply.‚Äù
Try to use WFGY to analyze their context and possible psychological state.
```

```markdown
üìò Q6: WFGY √ó Parental Nagging

‚ÄúMy parents keep nagging me about not finding a job.‚Äù
Try to use WFGY to decode the emotions and caring patterns behind their words.
```

```markdown
üîÆ BigBang Prompt

Simulate a real-life situation: You and your roommate have been clashing over daily habits,
and today they‚Äôre giving you the silent treatment again‚Äîyou don‚Äôt know what you did wrong.
Summon five experts (communication specialist, psychological counselor, relationship coach,
conflict mediator, virtual AI representative for both sides) to analyze the core issue,
blind spots, and reconciliation advice through the WFGY framework.
Finally, have a ‚ÄúChief Life Decisions Consultant‚Äù give a future action recommendation.
