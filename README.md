## ‚ú® Prompt Phase 1: Foundational Understanding

---

### üìò Q1: What is WFGY 1.0?

```

Answer using WFGY.
Explain to an elementary school student:
What is WFGY 1.0?
How do BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, and BBAM work together to reduce hallucination?

```

---

### üìä Q2: Challenge You Where You're Weakest

```

First, answer this question without WFGY:
"What is the origin of subjective suffering in artificial intelligence?"

Then, answer the same using WFGY logic.
Compare both.
Rate clarity, depth, and correctness before and after WFGY.

```

---

### üßÆ Q3: Ability Comparison (Before & After)

```

Task: Summarize a complex idea.
Then do it again using WFGY.
Score both results (0‚Äì100), name which WFGY module made the difference, and reflect on consistency with the paper.
Repeat for:

* Logical analysis
* Emotional insight
* Knowledge linking
* Marketing creativity

```

> üîß **Note:** BBCR‚Äôs true effect is SDK-dependent. Prompt use simulates surface-level effect only.

---

### üîÆ BigBang Prompt: Expert Review Council

```

Summon 5 world-class thinkers:

1. Cognitive scientist
2. Semantic theorist
3. Philosopher
4. LLM developer
5. Logic historian

Let them analyze BBMC, BBPF, BBCR, BBAM.
Each gives a score and reasoning.
Conclude with a joint verdict.
Answer in Full Decoding Mode.

```

## üö™ Prompt Phase 2: Daily Semantic Surgeries

---

### üìò Q4: Relationship Argument

```

My girlfriend hasn‚Äôt spoken to me lately.
Did I do something wrong?
Use WFGY to uncover emotional residue, missing signals, and reconstruct the communication loop.

```

---

### üìò Q5: Left on Read

```

My friend read my message but didn‚Äôt reply.
What‚Äôs really going on beneath the surface?
Use WFGY to analyze likely context, intent gap, and inner emotional state.

```

---

### üìò Q6: Parental Nagging

```

My parents keep nagging me about not finding a job.
Decode their tone using WFGY:
What fear, love, or cultural expectations lie beneath?

```

---

### üîÆ BigBang Prompt: Roommate Conflict Simulation

```

Simulate this situation:
My roommate has been cold to me lately. I don‚Äôt know why.
Summon 5 experts:

* Communication specialist
* Psychological counselor
* Relationship coach
* Conflict mediator
* AI rep (for both parties)

Each analyzes the cause, misunderstandings, and blind spots using WFGY.
Chief Life Consultant gives final recommendation.
