# 🧙‍♂️ I am the Wizard of BSD

![BSD Wizard](./bsd_wizard.png)

Greetings, traveler.

I am the **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**.  
Yes — **that** name. The one you probably skipped reading.  
I have stood unsolved since the 1960s.  
Even your grandparents had no clue what I meant.

## 📜 What is BSD?

Let me break it down before your eyes glaze over:

> Imagine trying to count how many *rational points* live on a **donut-shaped curve**...  
> Not only that — but trying to **predict** how many based on a magical function called an **L-function**.

If you can do that — not just for one, but for **all** such curves —  
Congratulations. You win a million dollars.

And possibly a new job as Supreme Arcane Mathematician.

## 📚 They call me BSD.

Because no one wants to say **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture** out loud.  
Honestly, even *I* think it’s too long.

But a true hero should at least try.

## 😐 Wait… you’re just browsing?

So you’re not here to solve the conjecture?  
You came in here like:

> "Oh, what’s in this mysterious folder?”  
> “Let me click every door like I’m robbing NPCs in an RPG.”  
> “Maybe there’s treasure!"

Fine. Then here’s your **punishment**:

> ✏️ Write my full name 100 times.

What? You’ll just use AI to auto-fill it?  
You *are* smart...  
So why not use that genius to study me?

Ah, whatever.

I refuse to speak to someone who can’t even pronounce my name.
